## Introduction
This was a small coding series of exercises involving the interaction between a software program and a MSP432 LaunchPad Development Kit from Texas Instruments. The program prompted a UI interface that builds and flashes the C code into the MSP432. The exercises consisted of changing LED colors, controlling LED blink period, designing input extraction using digital logic, and recalibrating formulas for measurements.

This couse is crosslisted as ECEG 247 taught by Professor Philip Asare.
